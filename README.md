# Report, C programming for Linux
This will be where i write my report for the C exam.

# Notes for submission

# Task 1
## A) Explain what the C programming language can be used for
The C programming language can theoretically be used to create anything, however it is commonly used in low level systems like embedded systems, operating systems, compilers and other low level software.

## B) Who is Dennis Ritchie and what is he known for in the field of Information Technology?
Dennis Ritchie is mos known for creating the C programming language in the 1970's. He also worked on the UNIX operating system which was used as a foundation of various operating systems we use today.

## C) List at least 5 differnet Linux "distros", explain briefly their background, if they have  any specific purpose, and how they differ from each other.
### 1. Debian
First announced in 1993, Debian GNU is a free and open sourced distribution. It is mainly used as a desktop operating system by developers and is highly configurable. It is stable and runs of numerous architectures.

### 2. Ubuntu
First announced in September 2004, Ubuntu is the most popular and widely used linux distribution. It aws created by Mark Shuttleworth, a former Debian developer. It is based on the development version of Debian (called unstable "Sid"), which contributes to the similarity of the distros. It is however not fully compatible with Debian. Its main traits are it accessibility and customizability. 

### 3. Arch
Created around the year 2002 by Judd Vinet, Arch Linux is an advanced distro made for intermediate and advanced Linux users. Its main feature is its powerful package manager Pacman which can among other things supports the rolling release of the distro, allowing the system to update itself through "rolling releases".
It is created to be configurable to the minutest details, allowing advanced users to mold the distro to their liking. It differs from the previous two with its "rolling releases" which is different from the stable builds of Debian and Ubuntu, and through its catering to advanced users. 

### 4. FreeBSD
FreeBSD was created in 1993 and comes with over 20 000 packages. It is mainly used for enterprise platforms in the shape of internet/intranet servers and embedded platforms, and is widely regarded for its stability, performance and security. It differs from the other distributions for mainly catering to enterprise platforms.

### 5. Fedora
Unveiled in September 2004, Fedora is a highly innovative distro which caters to Linux desktop users. It is similar to Debian and Ubuntu in this regard and is one of the most widely used distributions. The developers of this distro focus heavily on innovation and aims to be on the cutting edge of the Linux platform.
